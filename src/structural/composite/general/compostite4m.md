3. Composite Pattern
   Purpose: Treats individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

Main Components:

Component (Common interface)

Leaf (Individual object)

Composite (Collection of leaves or other composites)

Real-Life Example:

Folders and files in a file system â€“ A folder contains files and other folders, but both follow the same operations.

Practice: Design a menu system where a menu item (leaf) and a menu group (composite) behave the same way.
