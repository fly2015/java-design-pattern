1. Adapter Pattern
   Purpose: Converts an interface of a class into another interface that clients expect.

Main Components:
Target (Expected interface)
Adapter (Converts one interface to another)
Adaptee (Existing class with a different interface)
Real-Life Example:

Power adapter â€“ Converts a plug type to fit into another socket.

Practice: Create an adapter for a third-party logging library in your Java web project to match your existing logging interface.
