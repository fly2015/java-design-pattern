Defensive copying is a best practice in Java to ensure data encapsulation and avoid unintended side effects.
In the context of the Prototype Pattern, it's crucial when cloning objects with mutable fields.


If your class has only immutable fields, a shallow copy using super.clone() is sufficient.
If you have mutable fields, consider implementing a deep copy.
