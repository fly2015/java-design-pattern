ðŸ”¹ What is the Builder Pattern?
It separates the construction logic of an object from its representation.
The pattern allows constructing an object step-by-step while providing a fluent, readable, and flexible interface.
It is particularly effective when the object to be built requires many parameters, some of which may be optional.
ðŸ”¹ Why Use the Builder Pattern?
Readability: Makes object creation readable with a fluent interface.
Avoids Constructor Overloading: No need for multiple constructors to handle various parameter combinations.
Handles Complex Objects: Useful for creating objects with many optional fields or configurations.
Immutability: The final object can be immutable if required.
Reusability: The same builder can be reused for multiple variations.
ðŸ”¹ Key Components of the Builder Pattern:
Product: The complex object to be constructed.
Builder: The interface or abstract class that defines the construction steps.
Concrete Builder: Implements the Builder interface to create and assemble the product.
Director (Optional): Manages the construction process. Usually used when the construction process is complex.
