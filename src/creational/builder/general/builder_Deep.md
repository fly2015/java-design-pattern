ðŸ”· Builder Pattern - Summary
ðŸ”µ 1. What is the Builder Pattern?
The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern used to construct complex objects step by step. It separates the construction process from the actual representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

ðŸ”µ 2. Why Use the Builder Pattern?
To Handle Complex Objects: When creating an object requires multiple steps or configurations.
Readable Code: Avoids using long constructors with many parameters (telescoping constructors).
Immutable Objects: When creating immutable objects where all fields need to be set during construction.
Fluent Interface: Offers a chainable API for more readable and maintainable code.
ðŸ”µ 3. When to Use the Builder Pattern?
Situation	Why Use Builder
Complex Construction	When an object has many optional fields or configurations.
Avoid Long Constructors	When a constructor has many parameters, causing confusion.
Immutable Objects	When you need to build immutable objects step by step.
Consistent Object Creation	Ensures consistent object creation logic.
Readability and Maintainability	Provides a readable and maintainable way to create objects.
Multiple Representations	Supports creating different representations of the object.
ðŸ”µ 4. Key Components of the Builder Pattern:
Builder: Defines the steps to construct the object.
Product: The complex object being constructed.
Director (Optional): Manages the construction process, useful for complex scenarios.
ðŸ”µ 5. Example Scenarios for Using Builder:
Creating a House with optional features (garage, pool, garden).
Building a Car with various configurations (engine type, seats, GPS).
Configuring a Database Connection with optional settings.
Constructing HTTP requests with multiple headers and query parameters.
ðŸ”µ 6. Pros and Cons of the Builder Pattern:
Pros	Cons
Increases readability and maintainability	Increases code complexity for simple objects
Useful for creating immutable objects	May require a lot of boilerplate code
Supports step-by-step, controlled object creation	Not ideal for highly dynamic or unpredictable inputs
Can produce different representations of the object	Overkill for simple objects with few fields
ðŸ”µ 7. Builder vs. Factory Patterns:
Aspect	Builder Pattern	Factory Pattern
Complexity	For complex objects	For simple object creation
Object Variability	Many configuration options	Often a single method with if-else logic
Construction Process	Step-by-step, controlled	One-step creation
Immutability	Often used for immutable objects	Not necessarily used for immutability
ðŸ”µ 8. When NOT to Use the Builder Pattern:
When the object construction is simple and straightforward.
When the number of required fields is minimal.
When all fields can be set directly without ambiguity.
ðŸ”µ Conclusion:
The Builder Pattern is powerful for constructing complex, immutable, and configurable objects while maintaining code readability. However, it's essential to balance its use to avoid unnecessary complexity.
